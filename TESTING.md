## Lighthouse Results

All possible pages were checked using Lighthouse in desktop mode. Any unresolved issues were left as such because they are either out of my control (response times etc) or intensional. Results were not recorded as screenshots due to constant variations in score observed with repeat analyzing. These are the results I found at time of submission (your own results may vary based on page content at the time of testing):

| Page | Performance | Accessibility | Best Practices | SEO |
| ---- | ----------- | ------------- | -------------- | --- |

## User Stories

All user stories were achieved during development and were subject to manual user testing. You can see a list of all user stories in my readme [here](https://github.com/paulio11/P5-Pokebox#epics-and-user-stories).
