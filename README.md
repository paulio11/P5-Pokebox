## Introduction

Pok√©box is a user-friendly website that allows Pok√©mon enthusiasts to easily keep track of their Pok√©mon collections. The website is built using the popular React framework, providing a smooth and intuitive front-end experience. All data is stored in a SQL database managed by a reliable Django Rest Framework backend. The site pulls accurate Pok√©mon information from [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/), ensuring that users have access to the most up-to-date data for their collection.

Building a website like Pok√©box offers several benefits for users:

- Organization and Tracking: Pok√©box provides a centralized platform for users to effectively organize and track their Pok√©mon collection. It allows users to keep a comprehensive record of their Pok√©mon, including details like species, stats, types, and more. This can be particularly useful for avid collectors who want to maintain a detailed inventory of their Pok√©mon.
- Easy Access and Convenience: By having a dedicated website like Pok√©box, users can conveniently access their Pok√©mon collection from any device with an internet connection. This means you can easily manage and view your Pok√©mon data on-the-go, whether you're using a computer, smartphone, or tablet.
- Community Engagement: Pok√©box can foster a sense of community among Pok√©mon enthusiasts. Users can connect with like-minded individuals, share their collections, and adventures. It provides a platform for users to showcase their Pok√©mon achievements and engage in discussions related to the Pok√©mon world.
- Reference and Information: Pok√©box integrates with Pok√©API, ensuring that users have access to accurate and up-to-date Pok√©mon data. This can serve as a valuable reference tool for users. Having a reliable source of information can enhance their overall Pok√©mon experience.

## Project Planning

### GitHub Project

The GitHub project board feature was used to keep track of what I was working on and what still needed to be done. I created a user story for each feature, or an issue for each to do and bug, then moved them when necessary throughout the development of both front and back-end.

[Link to Project Board](https://github.com/users/paulio11/projects/4)

**Project Board:**

### Epics and User Stories

There will be two types of users visiting Pok√©box. A new or logged out user and registered users. User stories were logged as issues on GitHub to track them through the project (see [Project Issues](https://github.com/paulio11/P5-Pokebox/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)). They were subject to manual testing at the end of the project to determine if I was successful with my objectives.

### Timeboxing

Using MoSCoW prioritisation I categorised the features needed to meet the requirements of the user stories into the following categories:

#### Must Do

The final version of Pok√©box must include the following:

- User sign up
- User log in, log out
- Search for Pok√©mon
- Manage Pok√©mon collection
- View Pok√©mon collection

This would produce the **minimal viable product**.

#### Should Do

A more fully feature product would contain these features:

- View Pok√©mon information
- Read, post, edit and delete diary entries
- View other user profiles and collections
- List other users
- Search for other users

#### Could Do

And if there is extra time, these features could be included:

- User profile customisation
- Commenting on posts
- Viewing, editing and deleting comments

An early version of Pok√©box would contain the following - every **must do** feature, view Pok√©mon information and view other user profiles and collections from **should do**, and finally user profile customisation from **could do**.

Fortunately due to the length of this project I was able to produce all of the above features. There are many more possible features I could have added given more time. See [unimplemented features](#unimplemented-features) below.

## User Experience

### Wireframes

[Balsamiq for Desktop](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) was used ahead of development to plan the basic skeleton of all pages. You can download my wireframes file [here](https://github.com/paulio11/P5-Pokebox/blob/main/documentation/pokebox-wireframes.bmpr).

### Design Choices

#### Typography

Fonts are imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). The font used for all `h1` headings is [Lilita One](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lilita+One). Lilita One is a stylish and bold display font inspired by Art Deco lettering. When used for my titles, it creates a striking contrast with the rest of the text, adding visual interest and emphasis. The rest of the text all uses the same font **Segoe UI**. Below are two examples of the Lilita One in use.

**Home page header:**

![Home page header](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulio11/P5-Pokebox/main/documentation/images/readme-titlefont1.png)

**Page heading:**

![Page heading](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulio11/P5-Pokebox/main/documentation/images/readme-titlefont2.png)

#### Images

Besides the Pok√©mon sprites and art the only other images used on the website are those **added by users**. These include user avatars and images shared in posts. This keeps the focus where it should be on the Pok√©mon and the user content. A placeholder image is used in cases where an user has not yet uploaded an avatar. This image is also used as the brand logo and favicon.

![Brand logo and default avatar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulio11/P5-Pokebox/main/documentation/images/readme-logo.png)

#### Colour Scheme

Pok√©box uses a restrained colour-scheme. The color scheme features a combination of dark and light colors, creating a sense of depth and contrast. The dark red serves as a bold focal point for elements such as links, buttons and headings, while the grays and accent colors add balance and versatility. The majority of colour comes from the images of the Pok√©mon and user content - again keeping the focus where it belongs.

![Colour scheme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulio11/P5-Pokebox/main/documentation/images/readme-colours.png)

#### Layout

The website incorporates various Bootstrap components for its design and functionality. When viewed on desktop, the layout follows a two-column structure. However, on smaller screens like mobile devices, the navigation condenses into a user-friendly dropdown menu, and the layout seamlessly transitions to a single-column view. To ensure responsiveness across different screen sizes, Bootstrap containers and columns are employed to handle the layout adjustments. Here are some examples:

## Features

### API Integration

Pok√©box utilizes two powerful APIs to enhance its functionality. The first API is [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/), an exceptional free and open-source RESTful API. Pok√©API offers developers seamless access to an extensive range of data associated with the beloved Pok√©mon video game series. Through this API, developers can easily retrieve comprehensive information about Pok√©mon, including details about their species, abilities, moves, types, and much more.

The second API employed by Pok√©box is a custom-built back-end API, developed using Django Rest Framework. To explore further details about this API, please visit its dedicated [repository](https://github.com/paulio11/P5-Pokebox-API).

To talk to these APIs, I use [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro), a JavaScript library that allows making HTTP requests from web browsers. With Axios, I can interact with APIs by sending various types of requests, such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and more.

[AxiosDefaults.js](https://github.com/paulio11/P5-Pokebox/blob/main/src/api/AxiosDefaults.js) contains the necessary options to interact with two APIs. It defines three Axios instances with specific configurations:

1. `pokeApi` instance:
   - `baseURL` is set as the main PokeAPI endpoint, which is the base URL used for all relative requests.
   - The `Cache-Control` header is set to `no-cache` to resolve frequent data-fetching issues. By setting no-cache, failed requests are retried, ensuring fresh data is obtained when the page is reloaded.
2. `axiosReq` and `axiosRes` instances:
   - Both instances use the same `baseURL`, that of my back-end API, as the base URL for their requests.
   - The `Content-Type` header is set to `multipart/form-data`, indicating that POST requests use multipart form data.
   - `withCredentials` is set to `true`, allowing requests to include credentials like cookies, ensuring proper handling of authenticated requests.

### Components

Leveraging React in the development of Pok√©box enabled me to harness the power of components, which presented numerous benefits such as:

- React components can be reused across different parts of the application, saving time and effort.
- Components allow for a hierarchical and organized structure, simplifying the management and expansion of the codebase.
- Components promote clean and modular code, making it easier to understand, update, and maintain the application.
- Specific components can be updated without requiring a full page reload through React's virtual DOM, resulting in faster and more responsive user interfaces.

#### [Ball.js](https://github.com/paulio11/P5-Pokebox/blob/main/src/components/Ball.js)

This component is used on both the _Trainer List_ and _Trainer Profile_ pages. It takes the prop `size` (of the user's Pok√©mon collection) and returns a different image based on that size. Trainer's with a larger collection of Pok√©mon have their collection represented by a better Pok√©ball.

![Small collection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulio11/P5-Pokebox/main/documentation/images/readme-ball-pokeball.png)

![Medium collection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulio11/P5-Pokebox/main/documentation/images/readme-ball-greatball.png)

![Big collection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulio11/P5-Pokebox/main/documentation/images/readme-ball-ultraball.png)

![Complete collection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulio11/P5-Pokebox/main/documentation/images/readme-ball-masterball.png)

#### [CustomModal.js](https://github.com/paulio11/P5-Pokebox/blob/main/src/components/CustomModal.js)

Used in different situations, the modal feature improves user experience in specific areas. It is employed for the help modal on the _Pok√©mon List_ page, user avatar editing, and confirmation prompts for post and comment deletion.

- It uses the `useState` hook to manage the modal's visibility state.
- It defines functions to handle showing and closing the modal.
- The component renders a button that triggers the modal display.
- The modal component includes a header with a close button and a title.
- It also has a body section that renders it's children elements.

![CustomModal component](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulio11/P5-Pokebox/main/documentation/images/readme-modal.png)

#### [Error404.js](https://github.com/paulio11/P5-Pokebox/blob/main/src/components/Error404.js)

This component replaces the whole page if the user tries to navigate to a diary entry, trainer or Pok√©mon that does not exist. It is returned if the `noResults` state is true. It will also be rendered if the user visits a route that does not exist.

```
if (noResults) {
    return <Error404 pokemon query={id} />;
}
```

- The contents depend on the presence of certain properties. If `pokemon` is truthy, it includes the text "Pok√©mon". If `trainer` is truthy, it includes the text "trainer with ID:". If `post` is truthy, it includes the text "diary entry with ID:". If `page` is truthy, it includes the text "page you were looking for". The `query` is displayed within a `<strong>` element if it exists. The error message concludes with the text "could not be found."
- The button when clicked, triggers the `onClick` event handler, which navigates back in the browser history using the `navigate()` function.

![Error404 component](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulio11/P5-Pokebox/main/documentation/images/readme-error404.png)

#### [Footer.js](https://github.com/paulio11/P5-Pokebox/blob/main/src/components/Footer.js)

The _Footer_ component provides a simple `div` with a contrasting background colour. It is called at the bottom of the main `App.js` file so it appears on every page. Using the follow CSS rule ensures the footer is always rendered at the bottom of the browser window, `Page` contains the main bootstrap `<Container>` and the footer component:

```
.Page {
  height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: space-between;
}
```

#### [LoadingText.js](https://github.com/paulio11/P5-Pokebox/blob/main/src/components/LoadingText.js)

This provides a bootstrap `<Spinner>` component with the text "Loading...", center aligned and styled to match the rest of the website. Displayed while the `loaded` state is false, it gracefully transitions to the fetched data from the Pok√©box API or Pok√©API. It also serves as a loader within the `<InfiniteScroll />` component.

![LoadingText component](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulio11/P5-Pokebox/main/documentation/images/readme-loader.gif)

#### [NavBar.js](https://github.com/paulio11/P5-Pokebox/blob/main/src/components/NavBar.js)

The _NavBar_ component is a crucial element in the application's UI as it renders a navigation bar that dynamically adapts based on the user's authentication status. By placing it above the main container in the `App.js` file, it ensures the navigation bar appears consistently at the top of every page, providing easy access to essential links and options for seamless navigation throughout the application.

- It retrieves the current user and a function to set the current user from `CurrentUserContext.js`.
- The function `handleLogOut()` that is triggered when the user clicks on the "Log out" link. It sends a log out request to the Pok√©box API endpoint using the axios and then sets the current user to null.
- The component also defines two variables: `loggedOutItems` and `loggedInItems`. These variables store JSX code for the navigation links and options displayed when the user is logged out and logged in, respectively. The links include "Log in" and "Register" when logged out, and "Logged in as [username]", "Settings", and "Log out" when logged in.
- Mainly it returns a `<Navbar>` component from the React Bootstrap library. It includes the website logo, name, a toggle button for the responsive menu, and two sets of navigation links (one on the left and one on the right) that change based on the user's authentication status. The active link is highlighted using a CSS class.

**Expanded Navigation:**

**Collapsed Navigation:**

![Collapsed navigation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulio11/P5-Pokebox/main/documentation/images/readme-navbar-small.png)

#### [Pokemon.js](https://github.com/paulio11/P5-Pokebox/blob/main/src/components/Pokemon.js)

The component plays a crucial role in three sections of the application: the Pok√©mon list, the user's collection, and the favorite Pok√©mon display. Within these areas, it efficiently renders vital information for each Pok√©mon, including the sprite, ID, and name. Moreover, users can conveniently add or remove a Pok√©mon from their collection by simply right-clicking on this component while on the Pok√©mon List page.

- It manages the `collected` state using the useState hook, initially set to false. Then utilizes the `useEffect` hook to update the collected based on the user's Pok√©mon collection.
- It defines a `handleRightClick()` function to handle the right-click event, preventing the default behavior and instead it updates the user's Pok√©mon collection.
- The component handles styling based on whether the Pok√©mon's ID exists in the user's Pok√©mon collection array. This approach reflects the collected status of the Pokemon to the user, enhancing the visual representation of their collection.
- Clicking the component navigates the user to the relevant Pok√©mon Information page.

**The Pok√©mon component used on the list page, reflecting collected status:**
